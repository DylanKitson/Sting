# Sting
Sting is a small Python program to find average distances between multiple points based on images. 
This is an excellent tool to find hidden patterns between multiple sets of points, which are generated by the user clicking on an image 
using the left and right mouse click buttons.

##Usage 

When the program is initialized, you'll be prompted to open a .jpg or .png (such as an arial view of a physical site). The click in the 
top left, top right and bottom left of the image to create a virtual grid - this is used to generate coordinates). Then use the left mouse
click button to mark all members of species 1 and the right mouse click button to mark all members of species 2. Then click x to genarate
a graph (using Plotly) which displays the data generated.

###The 'resolution'

When prompted to set the resolution after clicking x, you are setting the class width of each average distance calculated. Higher resolution
values (e.g. 50) produce less-detailed graphs with wider classwidths. However, small resolution values can make it hard to determine trends.
A value of 5,10 or 20 is often best. You can generate multiple graphs with multiple resolutions based on the same set of coordinates by
re-clicking x.

##Potential Improvements

The user-set grid system could be removed. Sets of coordinated could be directly inputted - bypassing the use of grids and images.
Images could be scaled to fit the screen.
